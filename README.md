This is a React + nextJS isomorphic application with mongoDB. The app is about competency mapping. Company managers can create tests/quizzes and employees can resolve those tests. After all these the results are displayed with the help of charts and could offer a better understanding to company managers of what are the strengths and weaknesses of the company from competency point of view.
